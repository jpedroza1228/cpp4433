## Nonexperimental & Quasi-Experimental Research Strategies

-   sometimes it can be impossible to meet the requirements for an experiment

    -   when there are confounding variables

-   nonexperimental studies can minimize threats to internal validity by changing them to become quasi-experimental studies

-   **nonexperimental research strategies** and **quasi-experimental research strategies** differ by quasi-experiments limiting confounding variables and attempts to control threats to internal validity

    -   both compare group differences on your outcome of interest

## Nonexperimental & Quasi-Experimental Research Strategies

## Nonexperimental & Quasi-Experimental Research Strategies

-   groups are usually created that cannot be randomly assigned

    -   college graduate vs no college

    -   boys vs girls

    -   cat owners vs dog owners vs other animal owners

-   two methods for defining groups using these methods

    -   between-subjects design: nonequivalent group designs

    -   within-subjects design: pre-post designs

## Examples of Both Methods

-   Nonequivalent Group Designs

    -   compares preexisting groups

        -   differential research designs

        -   posttest-only nonequivalent control group design

        -   pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design

        -   cross-sectional developmental design

## Examples of Both Methods

-   pre-post designs

    -   compares two or more scores for all participants

        -   pretest-posttest design

        -   time-series design

        -   longitudinal developmental design

## Between-Subjects: Nonequivalent Group Designs

-   when you can't randomly separate into groups and you need to make comparisons between groups

    -   Book: comparisons in test performance between schools that are comparing students who can use electronic devices vs those that cannot use electronic devices

-   **nonequivalent group design** is when there is no way you can separate groups using experimental strategies

    -   groups are considered nonequivalent because the groups could be different from one another and the researcher cannot control for that
    -   How would your study and the expected findings be different if you had two preexisting groups to compare?

## Between-Subjects: Nonequivalent Group Designs

-   Threats to Internal Validity

    -   nonequivalent group designs always have threats to internal validity

        -   cannot have cause-effect relationship

    -   **individual differences** are going to be one of the largest contributors to internal validity threat

        -   since we can't use methods to minimize individual differences (randomization, matching, etc.) we have to assume that the groups could already potentially be different from one another

        -   there are many confounding variables that could be different, from the book example above, what are some potential confounding variables?

## Nonexperimental Designs with Nonequivalent Groups

-   **differential research designs** is a nonexperimental design (no manipulation) where you are interested in if there are differences betweeen the groups

    -   What is an example of a differential research design, that cannot be an experimental design

        -   Book: Comparing children from single-parent households and two-parent households in their self-esteem

    -   JP: The book talks about how nonexperiments and correlations are different because nonexperiments split continuous variables into groups, while correlational designs use continuous data

## Nonexperimental Designs with Nonequivalent Groups

-   **nonequivalent control group design** use preexisting groups, where one group is used as a control and the other group is used as a treatment condition

    -   Ex: comparing this class to a philosophy class in math knowledge

-   **posttest-only nonequivalent control group design** also seen as a static group comparison

    -   one or more groups gets a treatment, while another group is seen as the control, only one point of gathering data (posttest)

        -   no randomization

## Quasi-Experimental Design With Nonequivalent Groups

-   **pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design** involves gathering data before treatment/control and then after the treatment/control condition

    -   allows researchers to have a baseline and can compare groups at baseline to see if the groups are similar

    -   accounts for time-related threats to internal validity because both conditions are experiencing the same threats

-   What is history? How does it affect participants?

-   **differential effects** are differences between the conditions/groups that could be explained by different histories

## Within-Subjects: Pre-Post Designs

-   **pre-post designs** are slightly different from the pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group designs, because this is a within-subjects design

    -   one group of participants are experiencing the same treatment and are being tested before and after the treatment

    -   What is missing between the pre-post design and pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design?

## Within-Subjects: Pre-Post Designs

-   Threats to internal validity for pre-post designs

    -   history

    -   instrumentation

    -   order effects

    -   maturation

    -   statistical regression

-   Similar to a within-subjects experimental design, however; it lacks \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to address the threats to internal validity

    -   Why is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ blank not able to be used in a pre-post design

## Within-Subjects: Pre-Post Designs

-   nonexperimental pre-post design

    -   pretest-posttest design is the simplest nonexperimental pre-post design where you recruit a representative sample and test them before your treatment and then after your treatment

    -   Ex: examining test scores before and after a pandemic

## Within-Subjects: Pre-Post Designs

-   quasi-experimental pre-post design

    -   **time-series design** is a series of observations for each participant before a treatment followed by a series of observations after the treatment

        -   Ex: I ask you what your stress level is --> give you a pop quiz worth half your grade and tell you there will be more pop quizzes --> then never give you another pop quiz

        -   [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US)

    -   **interrupted time-series design** is when the treatment is not caused by the researcher

        -   Ex: COVID cases as a new variant comes out

        -   What could be another interrupted time-series?

## Within-Subjects: Pre-Post Designs

-   All of these tests are useful in examining trends before something happens and seeing how it may affect an outcome over time

    -   while there are threats to internal validity, if the data is stable before treatment, you may assume it is fine

-   possible there may be a trend already that is not contributed by your treatment/manipulation

-   can also only examine a single participant over time

    -   single-case applications of time-series designs called **single-subject designs** or **single case** are the examination of a single participant for a extended period of time

        -   it does not have to be an individual, it could be a single entity

    -   What are other entities that can be examined over time?

## Developmental Research Designs

-   **developmental research designs** are used to examine changes in behavior in relation to participants' age

-   What is a construct that would be useful for examining through a developmental research design?

-   there are two types of developmental research designs

    -   cross sectional (measured once) and longitudinal (measured multiple times)

## Developmental Research Designs

-   **cross-sectional developmental research design** use different groups of individuals, each representing a different age

    -   these groups are examined at one time point and then compared

    -   What type of design do cross-sectional developmental research designs fall under?

    -   JP: cross sectional term is often used in correlational designs where you test a sample once

        -   JP: can be expanded on, where you then look at a relationship between IV and DV but separate this relationship by age group

## Developmental Research Designs

-   strengths & weaknesses

    -   strengths include being able to make comparisons between developmental periods

    -   data can be collected in short period of time

    -   does not require researcher to follow or track participants

    -   limited in conclusions that are drawn (can't say for certain these trends/patterns/relationships due to differences in age)

    -   **cohorts** are participants that are of the same age (or are grouped together by some characteristic)

    -   What is a cohort that you belong to?

    -   Age cohorts may experience different situations/issues/benefits

    -   What are some things that you face that your parents/grand parents/great-grand parents did not have to face?

    -   these environmental differences in age groups are called **cohort effects** or **generation effects**

## Example

## Longitudinal Developmental Research Design

-   **longitudinal developmental research design** are when researchers follow groups/cohorts over an extended period of time

    -   Ex: [the 1970 British Cohort Study](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/1970-british-cohort-study/)

    -   it is a within-subjects nonexperimental design

        -   one-group pretest-posttest design where treatment is age

-   Book: well-being of a group of adolescents before and after parents' divorce

    -   Is this a time-series question or a longitudinal design?

## Longitudinal Developmental Research Design

-   strengths & weaknesses

    -   accounts for cohort effects

        -   same people are not different from themselves

    -   more conclusive because researchers can see how a behavior/other construct changes over time

    -   expensive

        -   need a lot of money to keep people interested for months/years/decades

    -   high dropout rates

        -   **participant attrition** or **participant mortality**

        -   these dropouts may influence how representative your sample is of the given population

    -   same participants being tested using the same measures

## Longitudinal Developmental Research Design

-   cross-sectional designs can be somewhat comparable to longitudinal designs by examining cross-sectional relationships for several time points

    -   has been referred to as **cross-sectional longitudinal designs**

## Comparing Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Designs

-   cross-sectional

-   longitudinal

## Comparing Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Designs

-   cross-sectional

    -   strengths

        -   time-efficient

        -   no long-term cooperation required

    -   Weaknesses

        -   individual changes not assessed

        -   cohort/generation effects

-   longitudinal

    -   strengths

        -   no cohort effects

        -   assess individual behavior changes

    -   weaknesses

        -   time consuming

        -   attrition

        -   potential for practice effects

## Applications, Statistical Analysis & Terminology

-   application & analysis

    -   quasi-experimental and experimental designs tend to use the same statistical analyses

-   comparing means between two groups/conditions

    -   t-test (independent or dependent)

-   multiple groups

    -   ANOVA

-   multiple conditions

    -   repeated-measures ANOVA

-   non-numerical outcome

    -   chi-square (not going to focus on this concept for this class)

-   If you are using a longitudinal study with more than 3 time points then none of these analyses are helpful

    -   these all treat time points (month, year, decade) as categorical variable

        -   comparing time point 1 to time point 2 and time point 3

        -   more appropriate analyses treat time as a continuous variable

## Applications, Statistical Analysis & Terminology

-   pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group design

    -   multiple time points and multiple groups

        -   mixed-design ANOVA

        -   making comparisons between time points

        -   making comparisons between groups

        -   examining interaction between time points and groups

## Applications, Statistical Analysis & Terminology

-   **quasi-independent variable** = independent variable

-   **dependent variable** = outcome

-   time-series analyses compares values before treatment and after treatment
