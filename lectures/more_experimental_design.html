# External Validity

- this form of validity is about how well your study *generalizes* both to other studies and to the general public
  - experiments can provide useful information about a relationship
  - not necessarily the best for generalizing 
  - this goes along with the concept of efficacy, which is how well a study does in a controlled environment
  
- real-world interventions and field studies provide better external validity
  - also establish effectiveness

---

# Pros &amp; Cons of Control Methods

- holding constant
  - limits generalization 
  - too much control
  - standardizes the experiment

- randomization
  - accounts for influences of extraneous variables
  - may not fully account for all extraneous variables
  - random assignment *should* account for these variables

---

# Control Conditions &amp; Manipulation Checks

- experimental condition
  - group that gets the experiment/stimuli

- control condition
  - group that gets either no stimuli, a limited stimuli, or a placebo

---

# No-Treatment Control Conditions

- instances where the control group does not get any stimuli/condition

- Ex: Drug trials
  - participants in the control group don't get any drug/placebo
  
- Issues
  - do not control for participant expectancies
  - ethical considerations about not providing anything to participants of control groups

---

# Placebo Control Conditions

- **placebo** is an inert medication (sugar pills) or a fake treatment, which should have no medicinal effect
  - can produce positive or helpful effects based on expectations
  - **nocebo** is a inert substance that can cause negative or harmful effects based on expectations 
  
- **placebo effect** is when the mind/psyche is having an effect on the body
  - psychosomatic effect on participants


---

# Placebo Control Conditions

- generate serious questions about interpretation
  - is the observed effect due to the treatment or because the placebo effect

- **outcome research** investigates effectiveness of a treatment
  - concerned with the outcome of the treatment than any part of the treatment

- **process research** is focused on the components of the treatment
  - what is actually working in an experiment/intervention

---

# Placebo Control Conditions

- **placebo control conditions** are when participants receive a placebo instead of the actual treatment
  - tests to see how much of the effect was due to the treatment vs the placebo effect
  - can then compare the no-treatment control group to see if there was an effect on the outcome from the placebo
  
- Controlling for extraneous variables &amp; control group
  - control group = either no treatment or placebo
  - controlling for variables = accounting for external factors that could influence your experiment
    
    + **internal validity** is the support for the cause-effect relationship and that your sample is representative of the population

---

# Manipulation Checks

- additional measure to assess how participants perceived the manipulation
  - also measures the direct effect of the manipulation
  - makes sure that IV has the desired effect on DV
  
- other manipulation checks should be included in your surveys
  - You should have a question that is EXTREMELY straightforward
  
    + Ex: *Small passage*. Click on the year 2022.
    
---

# Manipulation Checks

- two ways to check the manipulation

1. Explicit measure of the IV
  - include an additional 

2. Embed specific questions about the manipulation in the survey after participating
  - Did you enjoy participating?
  - What do you think was the purpose of the experiment?
  - Did you suspect that you were being deceived?

---

# Manipulation Checks

Most important scenarios for manipulation checks

1. Participant Manipulations
  - want to double check that your manipulation/treatment group is getting at the construct that you were interested in measuring
  - Ex: wanting to study stress but find out participants had low levels of stress with a self-report measure

2. Subtle Manipulations
  - the manipulation may be subtle, such as changing a small detail in the design
  - Ex: changing the words in a short story with uncommon synonyms

---

3. Placebo Controls
  - asking about a placebo can check that participants thought the drug/treatment was real

4. Simulations
  - check to see if participants perceive and respond to the simulation (real-world environement of an experiment)
---

# Simulations

---

# Simulations

- **simulation** is a creation of conditions/treatments in an experiment that simulate or duplicate the natural environment
  - Ex: flight simulators are not real-world scenarios but are supposed to train pilots to be prepared for the real world
  
- **mundane realism** is superficial changes to the physical environment to make experiments seem less like lab settings and more like the real world

- **experimental realism** is more concerned with the psychological aspects to a simulation
  - participants become immersed in the environment; forget they're in an experiment

---

# Simulation Example

- Stanford Prison Experiment
  - guards, prisons, even Zimbardo (warden) started to believe their roles
  - made the basement of a building feel like a real prison

---

# Field Studies

- **field studies** takes an experimental design and puts it in a place that participants perceive is the natural environment

- Some great examples of field studies are *bystander apathy*
  - participants helping others (confederates) in a public setting
  
---

# Pros &amp; Cons of Simulations &amp; Field Studies

- get more generalizable findings because they are in real-world scenarios

- loses control (internal validity) over the situation because real-world
  - no control over participants who are being observed

---

# Extra

- a more real-world experience would be creating an intervention
  - an "experiment" in a completely real-world scenario
  
- from these interventions, you can then move into creating a program
  - often referred to as an **Evidence-based Program**
  - programs that have been tested in controlled lab settings and translated into practical models
  
- these can be programs that are used in communities, schools, businesses, etc.
