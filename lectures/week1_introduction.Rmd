# Creating an Experiment

.pull-left[
- the experiment will revolve around group work
  - groups of 2 to 3...unless you want to work alone

# Creating an Experiment

- you will have to use more complex statistical analyses learned in PSY 3307

- Two options for research designs
  - repeated-measures design
  - factorial design

.pull-right[
- if CPP stays online, you'll have to get creative when administering your experiment
  - Ex: random selection = randomly putting participants into two break-out rooms in a zoom session
  - Ex: separate zoom rooms based on a criteria, taking survey within a certain time after eating dinner to see if it has an effect on what you are studying
]

# Getting Creative

- we will have discussion assignments where everyone will share their designs/surveys/etc. and **ALL** other students will offer some thoughts on improving the design/survey/etc.

---

# Creating a Survey

- we will work on this together during lab time

- we will practice using either `SurveyMonkey` or `Qualtrics`

---

# Writing an IRB Proposal

- Think of this as a working outline for writing the funding paper and the final research paper

- we will work on each part during lab and you will finalize each part to finish each paper

---

# Writing for Funding of your Project

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- will probably be the most difficult assignment

- a lot of formatting, but we'll cover this and you'll have examples

- used by many organizations
  - non-profits
  - academics
  - (private/public) research institutions
  - grant writer is a full-time position
]

---

# Final Paper

- Cover the main parts of the paper
  - Introduction
  - Method
  - Results
  - Discussion
  - Formatting

- Everything used in the IRB proposal and the funding proposal will make up a good chunk of this paper
  - you also have group members to help you out

---

# Group Presentations

.pull-left[

# What I Need From You

- Cameras are optional
  - It helps me see if you are confused
  
- Unmute yourself and interrupt me

- put in the chat that you are confused

- private message me in the chat that you are confused

# Why All of The Assignments JP?

- Survey design, creating a design, writing research papers, and applying for funding are all useful skills
  - throw in statistics and you can be pretty marketable
