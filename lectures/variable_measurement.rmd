# Agenda

- Variable Measurements
- Measurement Modalities
- Other Aspects of Measurement

---

# Measurement Scales

- **Scales of measurement** is the procedure of classifying individuals into categories*
  - **categorical** variables are those that can be put into groups/categories/conditions
  - **continuous** variables are those that provide a unique value for each participant; can have a decimal

# Categorical Measurements

- **Binary variables**
  - there are only two categories (sex)

- **Nominal variables**
  - categorize into groups; categories are not ordered (race/ethnicity groups)
  - can be binary and nominal

- **Ordinal variables**
  - ordered categories
  - categories indicate rank order (race order)

---

# Continuous Variables

- **Interval variables**
  - equal intervals on the variable represent equal differences in measurement
  - zero is not an absolute zero

- **Ratio variables**
  - similar to interval
  - true zero (zero is the smallest number)

---

# Examples

- Are the following examples categorical (nominal/ordinal) or continuous(interval, ratio)

- Money
- Grades
- Temperature
- Time spent online

---

# Examples

- Money
  - Cash
  - Bank Account(s)
- Grades
  - (A, B, C, D, F)
  - Exact Grades
  - Grade Brackets (100%-90%, 89%-80%, 79%-70%, etc.)
- Temperature
  - Fahrenheit
  - Celcius
  - Kelvin
- Time spent online
  - Hours/Minutes
  - Self-report

---

# Dealing with Equivocal Measurements

- We deal with numbers in weird ways sometimes
  - Likert Scale 1 (Strongly Agree) - 5 (Strongly Disagree)
  - Is this nominal? Ordinal? Interval?

- JP Note/Book: If using a single variable, then treat it on a nominal/ordinal scale
  - Unless, there are 10 or more categories (1-10 scale) then you can treat it as an interval scale

---

# Measurement Modalities

- Different types of modalities when collecting data
  - for this class, we will primarily be focused on self-reported data

---

# Self-Report

- common measurement modality in social sciences
  - **self report** is when participants report their own answers for surveys/questionnaires/forms/etc.

- advantage is that it is the most direct way of collecting data
  - offers good face validity
  - participants may answer differently to show a better image of themselves

---

# Physiological 

- **physiological** measures collect data from physiological manifestations of a construct
  - stress --> increased heart rate or sweat (galvanic skin response[GSR])
  - cognitive processing --> frontal lobe of brain (fMRI)

- commons measures
  - GSR
  - fMRI/MRI (functional tasks/still images of the brain)
  - PET (brain function/cancer)
  - EEG (sleep studies)
  
- advantage is that these measures are objective
  
---

# Physiological 

- disadvantage is that these require training, equipment
  - can also have subjective interpretation parts
  - parts of the brain --> what it means

- are they actually measuring the construct
  - sweating may not be from the experiment manipulation
  - could be from being connected to a weird device

---

# Behavioral

- **behavioral** measures can be both based on observation or through more structured manners to test the construct
  - behavioral test to measure smartphone use by seeing how many times participants unlock their phone
  - measuring disruptive behavior in a classroom

- are they actually measuring the core construct or are they situational
  - are they compulsive in constantly unlocking their phones
  - are disruptive kids always disruptive or just having a bad day

- best to measure a cluster of behaviors rather than one sole indicator

---

# Other Aspects of Measurement

- other than knowing how to measure your study/experiment constructs, you'll want to know
  - do you need more than one measure of each construct
  - will there be enough variation in each measure
  - how can you avoid unwanted noise in your data
  
---

# Multiple Measures

.pull-left[
- if you wanted to test validity of a measure
  - you would use at least two measures of the same construct

- a better alternative would be to collect data on a measure through different modalities
  - the measures may not behave in the same way
  - statistics with both measures can result in different findings

# Sensitivity & Range Effects

- if you expect small effects in your study, then you should have a measure that is **sensitive** enough to detect that effect

- one specific sensitivity issue is when scores group together because the task is either too hard or too easy
  - Ex: giving a spelling test, with grade school words
  - if your experiment is to help promote study tips, it could be useful but you won't see a difference
  
- when there is no room for improvement/change, there is a **range effect**

---

# Range Effects

- there are two instances of range effects
  - **ceiling effects**, which are when participants are already scoring high and cannot score any higher
  - **floor effects**, which are when participants are scoring too low and there is no way to score lower
  
- this is a difficult concept because unless you test this beforehand, you won't really know how easy or hard your task is

- JP Note: I gave a high school rated math exam and experienced a floor effect from CPP students from all grade levels

---

# Artifacts: Experimenter Bias & Participant Reactivity

- **artifacts** are external factors (not part of the experiment) that can influence your experiment
  - Ex: explaining the point of the study and someone walks into the study setting
  
- **experimenter bias** is when someone administering the study/experiment has some sort of effect on participants' responses/answers
  - could be part of the study (manipulating how you administer experiment materials) or an artifact
  - could be done intentionally or unintentionally
  
- Examples from the book:
  - tone of voice
  - facial expressions
  - body language

# Experimenter Bias

.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- one way to limit bias is to standardize the experiment
  - have a script

- "Blind" Experiments
  - **single-blind** experiments are when those administering experiments do not know the design of the study
  - **double-blind** experiments are better because both administers and participants do not know the design of the study
  
- experiments where participants do not know the design/hypothesis(es) of the study are not "blind"
]

# Demand Characteristics

- because we are using human participants, sometimes participants try to act accordingly to a study and behave in their best manner

- **demand characteristics** are cues of the study that suggest to participants what the purpose(s)/hypothesis(es) are
  - influence participants to react a certain way

- participant **reactivity** is when participants modify their behavior because they know they are being watched or know what is being measured
  - often a problem in a controlled **laboratory** setting
  - **field** research allows a more natural environment
---

# Different Roles

- **good subject role**
  - know the purpose/hypothesis and want to help the researcher by supporting the hypothesis

- **negativistic subject role**
  - know the purpose/hypothesis and want to act contrary to the hypothesis

- **apprehensive subject role**
  - try to answer in a way that is socially desirable, instead of truthfully

- **faithful subject role**
  - follow instructions and avoid trying to find the purpose/hypothesis
  - either know how science works and don't want to disrupt the study OR they don't care and want compensation (SONA credits or $)

# Selecting Measurement Procedure

- think about how you should measure each construct
  - validity & reliability
  - feasibility
  - what is the field doing/using?
  - if creating something, how will you test to make sure there are no range effects?
