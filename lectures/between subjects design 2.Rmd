# Group Project Analyses 

- For your project, you'll have 
  - two IVs
    
    + both IVs should have at least two conditions
    
    + one IV should be manipulated, other can another variable that literature states is important
  
  - continuous DV
  
  - 1 to 3 hypotheses
  
    + IV1 --> DV main effect
    
    + IV2 --> DV main effect
    
    + IV1*IV2 --> DV Interaction
 
---

# Example

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data.frame(groups = c('treatment', 'control'),
  male_groups = c('male_treatment', 'male_control'),
           female_groups = c('female_treatment', 'female_control'))
```

# Two-Group Mean Difference

- the simplest experiment is when you have two groups that you are comparing
  - we will take this one step further in your project

- the design is often called a **single-factor two-group design** or a **two-group design**

- advantage is its simplicity
  - comparing the means of two different groups (Control and Treatment Groups)

- disadvantage is the limited amount of information you have and get from the comparison
  - your treatment group is better at DV than control group
  - if you have more than 2 groups, then this is not very helpful because you would have to compare each group

--

  - problematic because of false positives
  
---

# Two-Group Mean Difference

- can use either a independent-samples t-test or One-way ANOVA

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
t.test(condition_values ~ product_type, data = data, var.equal = TRUE)
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>% 
  group_by(product_type) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean_value = mean(condition_values)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(product_type, mean_value)) + 
  geom_col(color = 'dodgerblue', fill = 'dodgerblue')
```

---

# Comparing Means for More Than Two Groups

- comparing more than two groups
  - **single-factor multiple-group design** 
  
- uses only a one-way ANOVA
  - determine differences in means of the outcome for each group/condition

- problem is whether you have a hypothesized group that will do differently than a group specifically (control)
  - or you just test everything (this is bad)
  
---

# Comparing Means for More Than Two Groups

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
aov_find <- aov(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars)
summary(aov_find)

```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
car::Anova(aov_find, type = 'II')
car::Anova(aov_find, type = 'III')
```


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
TukeyHSD(aov_find)
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
pairwise.t.test(mtcars$mpg,
                as.factor(mtcars$cyl),
                p.adj = 'bonf')
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
summary(lm(mpg ~ as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars))
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(as.factor(cyl), mpg)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = as.factor(cyl)))
```

---

# Comparing Proportions for Two+ Groups

- if your DV is nominal or ordinal (which is won't be), then you would look at the proportions within each cell 
  - cannot use t-test or ANOVA for this
  
- use chi-square tests of independence
  - non-parametric test
  
- JP Note: I rarely use this, but it can be helpful for certain scenarios (check the book)

---

# Comparing the Means for Groups Based on Another Variable

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
ancova_find <- lm(condition_values ~ product_type + celebrity, data = data)
summary(ancova_find)

```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
summary(lm(condition_values ~ product_type*celebrity, data = data))
```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
two_way <- aov(condition_values ~ product_type*celebrity, data = data)

summary(two_way)
```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
car::Anova(two_way, type = 'II')
car::Anova(two_way, type = 'III')
```


---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
data %>% 
  group_by(product_type) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean_value = mean(condition_values)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(product_type, mean_value)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = product_type)) 
```

---

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
data %>% 
  group_by(product_type, celebrity) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean_value = mean(condition_values)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(product_type, mean_value, group = celebrity)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = celebrity)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = celebrity)) +
  theme_light()
```
